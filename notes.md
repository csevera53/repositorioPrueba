This is Carlos, I'm 19 years old and I'm studying DAW. I have one younger sister. I like playing basketball, in fact, I play in a neighborhood team called Carolinas.
I also like to play videogames like League of Legends, Valorant or Rocket league in my free team. When I'm alone at home i usually watch movies or series. My favourite
at this moment is The Office, which is a sitcom from America, although it was mainly created in UK.
